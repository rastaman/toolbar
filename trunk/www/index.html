<p>ToolBar was originally designed for the ArgoUML project and has now been broken out to
allow reuse by other swing based applications.
</p>

<p>ToolBar comes with -
<ul>
<li>
    a toolbar manager to allow changes in look and feel to be
    broadcast to all toolbars in your application (not yet complete).
</li>
<li>
    a dropdown toolbar button that allows selection from multiple sub-items.
</li>
<li>
    a toolbar factory for simple creation of toolbars.
</li>
<li>
    a layout manager that allows toolbars to be docked to any edge of your 
    application window.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Mission</h3>

<p>To extend and improve upon the standard swing JToolBar features while keeping the
platform independant features of swing.</p>
<p>Application developers should be able to replace JToolBar with ToolBar with
minimum program changes (construction only)</p>

<p>Assumptions</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        ToolBar shall be Java2 compliant JDK1.3 and above (an attempt will be made 
        to make backwards compatible to JDK1.2)
    </li>
    <li>
        ToolBar shall always extend the standard swing component JToolBar to ensure
        easy replacement in existing swing applications
    </li>
    <li>
        The Metal look and feel will be supported together with the native look
        and feel provided by the JRE.
    </li>
</ul>

Initial development of ToolBar will be steered by the requirements of ArgoUML.
